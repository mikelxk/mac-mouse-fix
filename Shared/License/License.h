/// MARK: Enums
///     Note: Using simple consts instead of actual C enums because Swift is annoying about those.
///             How is it annoying? For example, you cannot simply cast integers to enums in Swift using `as?` - that always fails. Instead you have to use `init(rawValue:)` to create a special 'enum case struct instance' or something.
///             However, those initializers *never* fail even if you pass in values outside the enum range. So this serves no discernable purpose except being confusing.
///             What's extra confusing: If you declare the enums using `NS_ENUM`, or `NS_CLOSED_ENUM` in C, then`init(rawValue:)` in Swift will have have an optional return type (indicating that it's failable) but it will never actually fail. Which is extraaa confusing. (Tested this Oct 2024)
///             -> Because of these drawbacks, we just define a set of constants, instead of an actual enum. That way the behavior in Swift should be simple and consistent and match C.

/// MARK: Dataclasses

/// Define licenseTypeInfo classes
///     There are different types of licenses.
///         Each of the `MFLicenseTypeInfo` subclasses identifies a license type.
///         Additionaly, the `MFLicenseTypeInfo` instance properties may hold *additional metadata* relevant for the license type.
///
///     This 'metadata' could be useful to adjust the app's behaviour. For example:
///         - Showing a special thank-you message or other easter eggs for people who bought the 'generous' or 'very generous' tiers of a standard license.
///         - Showing the name of the HyperWork mouse that came with the currently active MMF license
///         - For a subscription-based business license:
///             - Saving the expiration date of the subscription, so that we can check-in with the licenseServer upon license expiration (And before expiration, we would do offline validation)
///             - Saving the business name, so we can show "Licensed to business: SpaceX" or something like that on the About tab.
///
///     Sidenote on *Metadata Particles*:
///         There might be repeated metadata fields between the different `MFLicenseTypeInfo` classes.
///         We were thinking of introducing an extra level of abstraction, where we group the metadata fields into collections called 'MetadataParticles'
///         which can be reused between licenseTypes. E.g. There'd be a `MFLicenseTypeInfoParticleSeats` particle which is present in the metadata for every licenseType that has multiple seats. It might contain the fields `usedUpSeats` and `nOfSeats` or something like that.
///         However, I decided that this extra abstraction layer is kinda unnecessary and overcomplicates things. Instead, we can just use keyValueCoding to access the repeated metadata fields across the different metadata classes in a uniform way.
///         For example we might use `[license.metadata valueForKey:@"nOfSeats"]` to get the `nOfSeats` regardless of which exact `MFLicenseTypeInfo` class is being used.
